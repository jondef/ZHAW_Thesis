Tastyworks released a public API. I can now use the API to automate my option trades.

discrete vs continous action space
td3 is self driving car
emsembles: train an ensemble of the agorthms -> outperform the best algorithm
overfitting

# The algorithms require a vectorized environment to run
env = DummyVecEnv ( [lambda: StockTradingEnv (df) ])
model = PP("MIpPolicy", env, verbose=1, tensorboard_ log="./tensorboard/")
model.learn (total timesteps=50000)
obs = env.reset ( )
results = [1]
